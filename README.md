# Microservices-POC-for-Learning
This repository contains a Proof of Concept (PoC) project developed for educational purposes. It is designed to explore and understand key technologies commonly used in modern microservices architecture, including:

RabbitMQ – for message brokering and asynchronous communication between services
ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) – for centralized logging, monitoring, and visualization
Docker – for containerizing applications and managing dependencies
Kubernetes (K8s) – for orchestrating containerized services and ensuring scalability and resilience

The project serves as a hands-on learning tool to experiment with integration patterns, deployment strategies, and observability in a distributed system.
